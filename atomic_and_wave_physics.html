<h1>What is a Wave?</h1>
<h3>Many types of energy travel as waves. Waves are vibrations that transfer energy as they move without any transfer of matter from place to place. Both sound and light travel as waves. There are two different types of waves - transverse and longitudinal waves.</h3>
<h3>Transverse waves are like the waves you see in the ocean. They travel up and down at 90 degrees to the direction they are travelling. Light waves and ocean waves are both examples of transverse waves</h3>
<h3>Longitudinal waves vibrate parallel to the direction they are travelling by compressing and stretching in the same direction the wave is travelling. Sound waves are longitudinal waves.</h3>
<br>
<h1>Measuring Waves</h1>
<h3>Transverse waves have three important measurements:
Amplitude - The height of a crest (top) or trough (bottom) of a wave that is measured from the middle or rest position.</h3>
<h3>Wavelength (λ) - The distance between two crests or two troughs</h3>
<h3>Frequency (f) - For moving waves, the frequency is the number of waves that pass a point in one second. Measured in Hertz (Hz). Frequency is determined by how rapidly the wave travels up and down. 
Period (T) - For moving waves, the period is the time it takes for a full wavelength to pass through a point. 
</h3>
<br>
<h1>phase</h1>
Points along a wave undergoing similar motion at the same time are said to be in phase. 
Points moving oppositely to each other are out of phase.
For travelling waves, points a whole number of wavelengths apart will be in phase. Those an odd number of half wavelengths apart are out of phase.
<br>
<h1>Calculating wave distance and speed</h1>
<h3>d = v x t
d = distance wave travels (m)
v = velocity or speed of wave (measured in metres per second) 
t = time it takes (measured in seconds)</h3>
<h3>If we consider the time it takes for wave to travel one wavelength (i.e. d=λ, t=T), we can rewrite the above equation as λ = v x T   or  λ = v / f. Rearranging, we get
 v = f x λ</h3>
