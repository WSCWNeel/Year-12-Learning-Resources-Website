<h1>Projectile Motion</h1>
<h3>Projectile motion is the 2D movement of an object (a projectile) launched into the air, where the only force acting on it after launch is gravity (ignoring air resistance). The path followed is a parabola.
</h3>
<h3>Key principle: The motion is broken down into two independent parts: 
Horizontal (x axis): Constant velocity because acceleration is zero (ax = 0)
Vertical (y axis): Uniform acceleration due to gravity (ay = -g)</h3>
<h3>Time (t): This is the crucial link between the two independent motions</h3>
<h3>Apex (max height): At the highest point, the vertical velocity (Vy)) is momentarily zero</h3>
<h1>Torque and Equilibrium</h1>
<h3>Torque is the rotational equivalent(equal to) of force. It is a measure of how effectively a force causes an object to rotate or twist around an axis or pivot point</h3>
<h3>Equilibrium is the state of an object where there is no change in its motion</h3>

<h1>Momentum and Impulse</h1>
<h3>Momentum is a measure of the quantity of motion an object has, while Impulse is a measure of how effectively a force changes that motion. They are directly related by the Impulse-Momentum Theorem.</h3>
<h3>Definition: The product of an object's mass and its velocity</h3>
<h3>J= F<sub>net</sub> △t</h3>
<h3>J is impulse (a vector quantity in the direction of the net force)</h3>
<h3>F<sub>net</sub>is the net force (often the average force in a collision).</h3>
<h3>△t is the time interval during which the force acts.</h3>
<h3>Conservation: In a closed system (where the net external force is zero), the total momentum remains constant. This is the Law of Conservation of Momentum, which is foundational to analyzing collisions and explosions.</h3>
