<h1>Electricity</h1>
<br>
<h2>Electric Fields</h2>
<h3>An electric field is a region around a charged object where other charges experience a force. It shows how electric charges interact without touching. The strength and direction of the field depend on the amount of charge and the distance from it — the closer you are to the charge, the stronger the field.
Positive charges produce fields that point away from them.
Negative charges produce fields that point toward them.
Electric field lines illustrate these forces: they never cross and are denser where the field is stronger. The electric field strength (E) can be calculated using the formula:
E = F / q
where F is the force on a test charge and q is the charge’s magnitude.
In short, electric fields explain how charges influence each other at a distance through invisible forces.
</h3>
<h1>Forces on charges</h1>
<h3>A force on a charge happens when it is placed in an electric field. The charge experiences a push or pull depending on the field’s direction and the charge’s type.
A positive charge is pushed in the same direction as the electric field.
A negative charge is pushed in the opposite direction to the field.
The size of the force depends on both the strength of the electric field (E) and the amount of charge (q), given by the formula:
F = q x E
In short, charged particles move or accelerate when they are inside an electric field because of the forces acting on them.
</h3>
<h1>Static Electricity</h1>
<h3>Static electricity is the buildup of electric charge on the surface of an object. It happens when electrons are transferred between materials through friction — one object gains electrons and becomes negatively charged, while the other loses electrons and becomes positively charged.
These charges stay in place (static) until they discharge, often as a small spark or shock when they move to balance out.
In short, static electricity is caused by the uneven movement of electrons, creating temporary electric charges that can attract, repel, or discharge suddenly.</h3>
<h1>Electricity and Currents</h1>
<h3>Electric current is the flow of electric charge (usually electrons) through a conductor, such as a wire. It moves from the negative side to the positive side of a power source, although we often describe current as flowing from positive to negative.
The size of the current depends on the voltage (energy pushing the charges) and the resistance (how much the material opposes the flow). It is measured in amperes (A) using the formula:
I = V / R
In short, an electric current is the movement of charges through a circuit, driven by voltage and limited by resistance.</h3>
<h1>Electricity - Circuits, Ohms Law, Power</h1>
<h3>A circuit is a closed path that allows electric charges to flow. It includes a power source (like a battery), a load (like a bulb), and conductors (wires).
Ohm’s Law relates voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R) in a circuit:
V = I x R 
This means the current increases with higher voltage and decreases with higher resistance.
Electric power (P) is the rate at which energy is used or transferred in a circuit, calculated as:
P = V x I 
It tells how much energy a device consumes per second.
In short, circuits allow charges to flow, Ohm’s Law explains how voltage, current, and resistance interact, and electric power measures the energy used by devices.</h3>
<h1>Magnetism</h1>
<h3>Magnetism is a force produced by moving electric charges or by certain materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt. Magnets have poles: a north and a south pole, where magnetic forces are strongest.
Opposite poles attract each other.
Like poles repel each other.
Magnetic fields show the direction and strength of magnetic forces, represented by field lines that go from the north pole to the south pole. Moving electric charges, such as in a current-carrying wire, can create magnetic fields, linking electricity and magnetism.
In short, magnetism arises from moving charges or magnetic materials, with forces that attract or repel and fields that describe their influence</h3>
<h1>Magnetic Field</h1>>
<h3>A magnetic field is the region around a magnet where magnetic forces can be felt. It shows the direction and strength of the magnetic force.
Field lines go from the north pole to the south pole outside the magnet.
The closer the lines, the stronger the magnetic field.
Magnetic fields can also be created by moving electric charges, such as in a current-carrying wire or a coil.
In short, a magnetic field visualizes how magnets or moving charges exert forces at a distance</h3>
